# py-lambda-action

A Github Action to deploy AWS Lambda functions written in Python with their dependencies in a separate layer.

## Use
Doesn't take any arguments. Deploys everything in the repo as code to the Lambda function, and installs/zips/deploys the dependencies as a separate layer the function can then immediately use.
### Structure
- Lambda code should be structured normally/as Lambda would expect it.
- **Dependencies must be stored in a `requirements.txt`**.
### Environment variables
Stored as secrets or env vars, doesn't matter. But also please don't put your AWS keys outside Secrets.
- **AWS Credentials**  
    That includes the `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, etc. It's used by `awscli`, so the docs for that [can be found here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-envvars.html).
- `LAMBDA_LAYER_ARN`  
    The ARN for the Lambda layer the dependencies should be pushed to **without the version** (every push is a new version).
- `LAMBDA_FUNCITON_NAME`  
    The Lambda function name. [From the AWS docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/lambda/update-function-code.html), it can be any of the following:
    - Function name - `my-function`  
    - Function ARN - `arn:aws:lambda:us-west-2:123456789012:function:my-function`  
    - Partial ARN - `123456789012:function:my-function`


### Example workflow
```hcl
workflow "Build & deploy" {
  on = "push"
  resolves = ["py-lambda-deploy"]
}

action "py-lambda-deploy" {
  needs = "Master"
  uses = "mariamrf/py-lambda-action@master"
  secrets = [
    "AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID",
    "AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY",
    "AWS_DEFAULT_REGION",
    "LAMBDA_FUNCTION_NAME",
    "LAMBDA_LAYER_ARN",
  ]
}

# Filter for master branch
action "Master" {
  uses = "actions/bin/filter@master"
  args = "branch master"
}

```
